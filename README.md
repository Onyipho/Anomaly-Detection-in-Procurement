# Anomaly-Detection-in-Procurement
We applied and compared several machine learning models to unlabeled dataset obtained from a combination of relevant procurement tables. To ensure a robust evaluation of the models in the prediction of anomalies on the unlabeled dataset, we utilized the time Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualizations to assess the clustering and separation of anomalies. The results showed that Isolation Forest, Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA)-Optimized K-Means and Ensembled model provided the highest performance, with clear separation and minimal overlap of anomalies. Permutation importance Explainable AI (XAI) techniques were employed to identify key features influencing anomaly detection. The findings contribute to enhanced risk management and decision-making in procurement operations, supporting the company in maintaining the integrity of her procurement processes. In the future, the labelled dataset will be trained on a model to proactively predict out-of-sample (in process) procurement transactions as normal or abnormal. Weâ€™ll attempt to employ Network Architecture Search(NAS)with reinforcement learning  for a deep learning model and compare results with traditional machine learning models.
